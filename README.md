It's a source code. I made it in like 30 minutes in python. If you'll just fucking skid it please give me a credit

# REMINDER
The Autotime.py is the source
Autotime.exe is still the same but converted into exe

# HOW TO USE?
1. Download Autotime.exe
2. Open it
3. Get into any roblox hoop game make sure it has shooting mechanics [ex. highschool hoop demo]
4. After that you're done

# CONTROL
Q is for shooting ms
